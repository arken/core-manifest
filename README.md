# core-manifest
The Core Arken Manifest is a curated index of important scientific and open source knowledge archived by the Core Arken Cluster. 

### How can I upload data to the Core Manifest?
If you're a researcher, collections curator, or open source publisher check out [AIT (the Arken Import Tool)](https://github.com/arken/ait) to create an application and if accepted upload your data to the cluster. If you have any questions or need some help, reach out to us at `team [at] arken.io`. 

##### Requirements of Applications to the Core Manifest
1. If your data is not open souce (meaning it is not licensed for free use and redistribution) you must own the copyright to the data you are uploading or attach a letter from the copyright owner in your application giving permission to the Arken project to host and redistribute the content.
2. Within your application please explain why your data is important to you, or to the world, and tell us why it should be backed up.
